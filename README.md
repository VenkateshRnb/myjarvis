MyJarvis is a conversational personal assistant useful to make our life simple. It is still under development 

I have used api.ai to code the backend and a simple Javascript for Client-side interface.

# Usage:
- Simply use your web browser to run the html file. The app starts with greeting.

- In case you find trouble using microphone. Try to give microphone access permission for this app in your browser microphone settings.

- You can also simply type the available commands in the text box and press ENTER to send the command manually

- This app is still under development. Any suggestions are welcome.

- Feel free to use the code and develop your own personal assistant. Thank this man Patrick Catanzariti (Twitter: @thatpatrickguy, find him at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com ) .His project idea (https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-your-own-ai-assistant-using-api-ai/) has led me to do this.
